# TODO

Step 1 - manual testing:
* Code climate badge
* All workflow by a responsive browser setting
* Deployment
* Recheck a responsive design by a mobile phone

Step 2:
* Frontend autotests

Step 3 - badges, utils
* google speed insights and other google tools
* GTMetrix tests - add screen shots
* Code complete badges
    * quality
    * code coverage
* Documentation polishing

## Future improvements
* Not logged user follows the /surveys URL - a request returns 401 status. Cookie based app, how to avoid the request?
* Common backend-frontend library to store model interfaces
