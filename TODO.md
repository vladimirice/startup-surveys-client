Step 1.1 - manual testing:
* Test with opened console - fix all errors
* Check a responsive design by browser
* Check a responsive design by a mobile phone

Step 2:
* Frontend autotests

Step 3 - badges, utils
* google speed insights and other google tools
* GTMetrix tests - add screen shots
* Code complete badges
    * quality
    * code coverage




## Future improvements
* Not logged user follows the /surveys URL - a request returns 401 status. Cookie based app, how to avoid the request?
