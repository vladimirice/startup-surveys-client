# TODO

Create a landing component for non-authorized users with a single card - `welcome`

Make it not possible to create a survey without credits


Step 1:
* Implement CSS modules - avoid inline styling of Form and ThanksPage
* Serve all image by yourself
* Observe all console errors
* Check a responsive design
* Application components refactoring

Step 2:
* Frontend autotests

Step 3 - badges
* Code complete badges
    * quality
    * code coverage


## Future improvements
* Not logged user follows the /surveys URL - a request returns 401 status. Cookie based app, how to avoid the request?
* Common lib to store model interfaces
